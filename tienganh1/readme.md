Welcome to the mini story for Day of the Dead. In the mini story I will do 3 things. I will make a
Statement. For example, “I arrived in Guatemala.” When you hear a statement, a sentence, you just
Say, “Ah,” or, “Oh.” You need to say that. Show that you understand this is not a question. A statement
Is not a question, so when you hear a statement say, “Ah.” For example, “I arrive in
Guatemala.” “Ah.”
The second thing I will do is ask a question you know the answer to. For example, “Where do I
Arrive?” I will stop. You say the answer. You must say the answer to every question. I say, “I arrive
In Guatemala. Where did I arrive?” You say, “Guatemala.” Easy.
And No. 3, I might ask a question you don’t know the answer to. If you don’t know the answer just
Guess. Say any answer, but you must answer every question. Use your pause button if necessary.
